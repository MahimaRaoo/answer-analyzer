ANSWER ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION
=======================

Introduction
-------------
Answer analysis using bag of words, tf_idf model,Gensim and NLTK.
Tf–idf weighting schemes are used as a central tool in scoring and
ranking a document's relevance. Gensim is used to handle large text 
collections, using data streaming and efficient incremental algorithms.
NLTK libraries provide various packages and methods to carry out natural 
language processing.



How To Use The program
-----------------------
1.The python file contains raw_documents where the ANSWER KEY has to be added.
2.The question also should be set at QUESTION TO BE ASKED field.
3.Change the location in the LOCATION OF DOCUMENT field accordingly.
4.The students answer is inserted in the console when the program is run.


Modules and dependencies
--------------------------
1.Python 3.5 must be installed.
2.Download get-pip.py.
3.Then,from the command prompt: 
easy_install numpy
easy_install scipy
pip install --upgrade gensim
Install NLTK: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk
Test installation: Start>Python35, then type import nltk


WEB SCRAPING
=======================

Introduction
-------------
Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. 
Fetching is the downloading of a page. Once fetched,
then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed,
searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on.
Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it 
for another purpose somewhere else.This progam implements a simple web
scraping algorithm.



How To Use The program
-----------------------
1.The URL must be type in the ENTER THE URL field.
2.It creates and stores the information into scrape.txt and it outputs 
the scraped content as lists on the console.

Modules and dependencies
--------------------------
1.Python 3.5 must be installed.
